# Project Name

My practical work in programming "Practical React App"

# Description

The purpose of this work was to create a ToDo-List application (electronic notebook) where you can write items, add, edit and delete them. Items are mapped, added and deleted to/from Localstorage. I created a Practical React App, and Header navigation using React route to navigate between Home, Calculator, Choice, BlogPosts and About pages. On the Choice page, I created two more pages, PVM-Counter and ToDo-List, using Nested React route to navigate between them. I placed the VAT rate application on the PVM-Counter page, and I placed the ToDo-List application on the ToDo-List page. I added a Footer, which, like the Header, does not change when navigating through the pages. BlogPosts page displays data from fake json-server. Data can be added and deleted. Add data through API platform Postman. The entire Practical React App used CSS and BOOTSTRAP CSS styles.
